The PyData Berlin conference happend in the first weekend July, at the HTW. It was a total of 3 days of interesting subjects, including a first day of tutorials. I was happy to have my talk proposal accepted, and had the oportunnity to some of the work done during my PhD on Semantic Relationship extraction.
