KOVENS is a yearly held conference which gathers together the computer scientists
and computational linguists community working with the German language.

This year's edition of KOVENS was held in the city of Erlangen, Germany, at the
Friedrich Ebert University. The conference lasted for 4 days, being the first
reserved to tutorials and workshops and the following days to presentations and
poster sessions, with coffee breaks and networking in between, which are
essentially to motivate communication, keep the good mood and get to know each other.

# Workshop

<!-- Data Challenge and Participation -->

This year's workshop hold a data-challenge, GermEval, consisting of two shared
tasks, much inspired in the vein of [SemEval](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/SemEval)
but focusing on German NLP tasks. Two tasks were proposed:

- [GermEval Task 1, 2019 — Shared Task on Hierarchical Classification of Blurbs](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20139)
- [Germeval Task 2, 2019 — Shared Task on the Identification of Offensive Language](https://projects.fzai.h-da.de/iggsa)

## GermEval: Hierarchical Classification of Blurbs

The Comtravo data science team participated on the Hierarchical Classification
task. The challenge consisted on a hierarchical-document classification task where
the hierarchical structure of each document needs to be captured. The documents
were short descriptions of books and one needed to classify them into the many
possible categories.

</div>

The task was further divided into two sub-tasks, one targeting only the first level
of the hierarchy (Sub-Task A) and the second targeting the second and third levels
(Sub-Task B). In our approach to the task we explored two different strategies.

The first one was based on more classic machine learning approach, a logistic
regression classifier with TF-IDF weighted vectors. The second approach was
based on Convolutional Neural Networks for text classification.

Our submissions achieved the 13th place out of 19 submissions for Sub-Task A and
the 11th place out of 19 submissions for Sub-Task B. You can read the paper with
description of our approach: [COMTRAVO-DS team at GermEval 2019 Task 1 on
Hierarchical Classification of Blurbs](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/germeval-2019-hmc/paper-4.pdf)
and the code is [publicly available](https://github.com/davidsbatista/GermEval-2019-Task_1).

We still had many extensions and ideas to add to these two baselines worth exploring,
but time constrains we only submitted baseline systems for other ideas worth exploring.

One curious aspect of both wining solutions for this challenge was that they used
totally different approaches for the task. One was based on state-of-the-art neural networks for seq2seq tasks, and the other based on SVM and TF-IDF weighted vectors for
text representation.

You can read the papers of both best winners here:

Convolutional Seq2Seq](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/data/konvens/proceedings/papers/germeval/Germeval_Task1_paper_2.pdf)
 - [TwistBytes - Hierarchical Classification at GermEval 2019: walking the fine line (of recall and precision)](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/data/konvens/proceedings/papers/germeval/Germeval_Task1_paper_6.pdf)

## GermEval: Identification of Offensive Language

The second shared-task attracted much more participants, and dealt with the
classification of German tweets. The task contained 3 sub-tasks, a coarse-grained
binary classification task (i.e., is the tweet offensive or not-offensive); a
fine-grained multi-class classification task (i.e.,  insult, abuse, profanity);
and a final classification wether the offensive tweet is implicit or explicit.
The wining solution for most of the subtasks was based on BERT:

# Main Conference

After the workshop the following days were dedicated to several topics within
NLP applied to German. Having a mixed community of computer scientists and
computational linguists results in a diverse type of research work. I will
briefly list some of the papers that caught my attention.

<!-- Interesting Papers/Posters -->

The BERT approach for many tasks was present in some of the works presented,
Wiedemann et al., carried a long study on how different contextualized word
embeddings perform on the task of Word Sense Disambiguation, _[Does BERT Make Any
Sense? Interpretable Word Sense Disambiguation with Contextualized Embeddings](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/data/konvens/proceedings/papers/KONVENS2019_paper_43.pdf)_.

BERT was also used for the named-entity  recognition task over historical german
text, _[BERT for Named Entity Recognition in Contemporary and Historic German Kai
Labusch, Clemens Neudecker and David Zellhöfer](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/data/konvens/proceedings/papers/KONVENS2019_paper_4.pdf)_.

Ortmann et al., evaluated several out-of-the-box NLP software packages for processing
German, on several distinct tasks such as tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging,
lemmatisation, dependency parsing, _[Evaluating Off-the-Shelf NLP Tools for German](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/data/konvens/proceedings/papers/KONVENS2019_paper_55.pdf)_

Koppen et al., presented a work on _[Label Propagation of Polarity Lexica on Word Vectors](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/data/konvens/proceedings/papers/KONVENS2019_paper_24.pdf)_, an automatic method to expand
sentiment lexicons for tasks such as sentiment analysis.

There was also research work on a more linguistic oriented perspective, which I found
interesting. _[Metaphor detection for German Poetry](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/data/konvens/proceedings/papers/KONVENS2019_paper_37.pdf)_ analysis a manually created dataset of adjective-noun pairs
from expressionist poems, annotated with metaphoricity and a method to detect
metaphors in poems.


# Summary

Although still small when comparing with other broader NLP academic conferences
such as EMNLP or ACL, I believe KOVENS is the place to discuss and follow research
work on NLP applied to German, and according to comparison with last years its
growing in dimension.

The data-challenge workshops are also an interesting playground
to apply and explore new methods and provide open data for the community.

I'm looking forward for next editions, which will take place in Switzerland,
[co-located with SwissText](http://swisstext-and-konvens-2020.org/).
