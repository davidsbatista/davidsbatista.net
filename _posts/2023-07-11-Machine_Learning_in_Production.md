### __Introduction to Machine Learning in Production__


- Steps of an ML project
- Example with a speech recognition
- Very high-level just to peek into what's coming 


### __Machine Learning Modeling Pipelines in Production__




### __Deploying Machine Learning Models in Production__

this one was of particular interest to me, mainly because of these topics:

- dimensionality reduction
- quantization and pruning
- distillation techniques
- interpretability


### __Machine Learning Data Lifecycle in Production__


- feature engineering, data transformation, data lineage and provenance, and how to rely on schemas to follow data evolution.
- Authors tend to oversell TensorFlow Extended, anyway, the main thing is to learn the concepts.
