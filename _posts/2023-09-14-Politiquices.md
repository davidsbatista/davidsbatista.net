Back in 2020, I was awarded the 2nd place in the [Arquivo.pt Awards 2021](https://sobre.arquivo.pt/en/meet-the-winners-of-the-arquivo-pt-award-2021) for the [Politiquices project](https://www.politiquices.pt). The project aimed at extracting supportive or opposing relationships between political personalities from newspaper headlines archived by [Arquivo.PT](https://www.arquivo.pt), and associating the political personalities with their identifier on Wikidata, thus resulting in a semantic graph. I [published a paper](https://davidsbatista.net/assets/documents/publications/politiquices_dsbatista_20230705.pdf) in Portuguese describing this work in [Linguamatica v. 15 n. 1](https://linguamatica.com/index.php/linguamatica/issue/view/30). The content of this blog post is the same as in the paper but translated to English.
