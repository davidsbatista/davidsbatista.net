Back in 2020, I was awarded the 2nd place in the [“Arquivo.pt Awards 2021”](https://sobre.arquivo.pt/en/meet-the-winners-of-the-arquivo-pt-award-2021) for the [Politiquices project](https://www.politiquices.pt).


Political news headlines often report supportive or opposing relationships between personalities, for
example: “Marques Mendes criticizes Rui Rio’s strategy” or “Costa reaffirms confidence in Centeno.” In this work we analyzed thousands of archived titles, identifying those that express supportive or opposing relationships, and associating the political personalities with their identifier on Wikidata, thus resulting in a semantic graph. The graph allows answering questions involving political personalities and parties. We describe the graph generation process and make it available together with a labelled dataset, which allows supervised learning classifiers to be trained to identify the relationships expressed in the titles and link the personalities with Wikidata.
