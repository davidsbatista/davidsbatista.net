Hi! My name is David, I live in Berlin and I love to play with data and extract knowledge from large volumes of data, be it structured or unstructured, numbers or text. 

I hold a [Ph.D.] in Natural Laguange Processing and Machine Learning, where I explored and proposed new methods for [semantic relationship extraction]. You can see a complete list of my publications as index on my [Google Schoolar] page.

I'm interested in the following topics:

* Natural Language Processing
* Information Extraction (i.e., Named-Entity Recognition, Relationship Extraction)
* Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning

I hold a Ph.D. from [Instituto Superior Técnico] under the supervision of [Professor Mário Jorge Gaspar da Silva]. My dissertation, entitled [Large-Scale Semantic Relationship Extraction for Information Discovery], addressed the problem of extracting [semantic relationships] between named-entities at large-scale.

The proposal consisted developing an [on-line supervised classifier] based on [min-hash] and [locality sensitive hashing], and generating training data for this classifier by a [bootstrapping approach relying on distributional word representations] (i.e. [word embeddings]). This approach is combined in the [TREMoSSo framework].

Before, I was a master student at [XLDB], my [master thesis (in Portuguese)] consisted in developing an information extraction system, which generates geographic summaries. Each summary lists geographic entities, found in a document, linked (i.e., disambiguated) to a [geographic ontology]. The system was applied to a [crawl of the Portuguese Web] using a Hadoop cluster.

I graduated from [Faculty of Sciences], [University of Lisbon], and between 2005 and 2006 I did two semesters as an exchange student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)] (former Universität Karlsruhe) under the Erasmus program. Before enrolling in my master, I worked as a software developer for [Nokia Siemens Networks].
