Hello! :) I'm David Batista and I currently live in __[Berlin]__.

I have experience in both research and industry and I enjoy working on solutions from concept to production, transforming natural language text into structured data. I considered myself a practical problem solver and like to deliver production ready software, not just results.

I hold a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing where I explored and __[proposed methods for semantic relationship extraction]__. You can see a complete list of my __[publications]__  and my detailed __[Curriculum Vitae]__.

I'm also the creator and maintainer of __[Politiquices.PT]__ a semantic graph connected with Wikidata, which allows to explore political interactions of support and opposition based on archived news articles from the past 25 years.

I occasionally write <a href="/posts/"><b>blog posts</b></a> mostly about Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I have a strong interest in the following topics:

* Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics
* Information Extraction: Named-Entity Recognition and Relationship-Extraction, Entity Linking
* Knowledge Bases and Semantic Graphs
* Machine Learning and Neural Networks applied to NLP tasks
