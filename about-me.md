Hello! My name is David Batista, and I'm currently based in [__Berlin__](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=19OMZvuXI0bNyCy-tEzsEglB7UmY&hl&ll=52.51602753988408%2C13.316764005371056&z=10){:target="_blank"}. 

With over 10 years of experience in research and industry settings, I enjoy working on end-to-end solutions for unstructured data, particularly transforming natural language text into structured data.

My expertise lies in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, and I have tackled various challenges such as information extraction (e.g., named-entity recognition, relationship extraction, entity disambiguation), classification, clustering, and information retrieval.

I hold a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing, where my focus was on [__semantic relationship extraction__](http://davidsbatista.net/assets/documents/publications/dsbatista-phd-thesis-2016.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and I've also authored of multiple [__scientific publications__](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=-tRNGd0AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, more details about my scientific and professional career are detailed in my [__Curriculum Vitae__](https://www.davidsbatista.net/assets/documents/dsbatista-cv.en.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

I am the creator and maintainer of [__Politiquices.PT__](https://www.politiquices.pt){:target="_blank"}, a semantic graph connected with Wikidata. This platform allows the exploration of political interactions of support and opposition based on archived Portuguese news articles spanning a period of time from 1994 up to 2022.

Occasionally, I write <a href="/posts/" target="_blank"><b>blog posts</b></a> primarily about Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. 

I am available for consultancy or freelance work on projects, subject to my time availability and ongoing commitments. Please feel free to contact me if you require assistance with the following topics:

* Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics
* Information Extraction, including Named-Entity Recognition, Relationship Extraction, and Entity Linking
* Knowledge Bases and Semantic Graphs
* Application of Machine Learning and Neural Networks to NLP tasks
