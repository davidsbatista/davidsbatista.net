I’m an experienced machine learning engineer and software developer, with a strong background in Natural Language Processing. 

I hold a Ph.D, where I focused on [__semantic relationship extraction__](http://davidsbatista.net/assets/documents/publications/dsbatista-phd-thesis-2016.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and I've authored multiple [__scientific publications__](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=-tRNGd0AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.
