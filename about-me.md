Hi! :-)

My name is David, I live in __[Berlin]__ and I love to play with data and extract knowledge from large volumes of data, specially to transform natural language into structured data.

I hold a __[Ph.D.]__ degree in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, where I explored and proposed new methods for __[semantic relationship extraction]__. You can see a complete list of my publications as indexed by __[Google Schoolar]__.

My CV is available for download as <a href="/assets/documents/dsbatista-cv.en.pdf"><b>a PDF file</b></a>. I occasionally <a href="/archive/"><b>blog</b></a> mostly about Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I'm interested in the following topics:

* Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics
* Information Extraction tasks such as:
  * Named-Entity Recognition
  * Relationship Extraction
  * Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Neural Networks / Deep Learning
