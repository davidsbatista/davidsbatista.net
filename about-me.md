Hello! :) I'm David Batista and I currently live in [Berlin](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=19OMZvuXI0bNyCy-tEzsEglB7UmY&hl&ll=52.51602753988408%2C13.316764005371056&z=10){:target="_blank"}.

I have experience in both research and industry and I enjoy working on solutions from concept to production, transforming natural language text into structured data. I considered myself a practical problem solver and like to deliver production-ready software, not just results.

I hold a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing where I explored and proposed [methods for semantic relationship extraction](http://davidsbatista.net/assets/documents/publications/dsbatista-phd-thesis-2016.pdf){:target="_blank"}. You can see a complete list of my [publications](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=-tRNGd0AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.  and my detailed [Curriculum Vitae](https://www.davidsbatista.net/assets/documents/dsbatista-cv.en.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

I'm also the creator and maintainer of [Politiquices.PT](https://www.politiquices.pt){:target="_blank"} a semantic graph connected with Wikidata, which allows exploring political interactions of support and opposition based on archived news articles from the past 25 years.

I occasionally write <a href="/posts/" target="_blank"><b>blog posts</b></a> mostly about Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I have a strong interest in the following topics:

* Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics
* Information Extraction: Named-Entity Recognition and Relationship-Extraction, Entity Linking
* Knowledge Bases and Semantic Graphs
* Machine Learning and Neural Networks applied to NLP tasks
