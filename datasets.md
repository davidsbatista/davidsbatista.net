## __Relationship Extraction__

I've been keeping track of [public and free datasets for relationship extractions](https://github.com/davidsbatista/Annotated-Semantic-Relationships-Datasets), the repository contains annotated datasets which can be used to train supervised models for the task of semantic relationship extraction. The datasets are organized into  3 groups: Traditional Information Extraction, Open Information Extraction, Distantly Supervised.
