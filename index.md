Hello! :)

My name is David Batista and I currently live in [Berlin](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=19OMZvuXI0bNyCy-tEzsEglB7UmY&hl&ll=52.51602753988408%2C13.316764005371056&z=10){:target="_blank"}.

I gather 10+ years of experience in both research and industry environments and I love working on solutions from concept to production around unstructured data such as text, specially challenges that involve transforming natural language text into structured data.

In the past I’ve tackled problems with a strong Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing components, involving tasks such as information extraction (e.g.: named‑entity recognition, relationship extraction, entity disambiguation), classification, clustering and information retrieval.

I hold a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing where I explored and proposed [methods for semantic relationship extraction](http://davidsbatista.net/assets/documents/publications/dsbatista-phd-thesis-2016.pdf){:target="_blank"}. You can see a complete list of my [publications](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=-tRNGd0AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} and my detailed [Curriculum Vitae](https://www.davidsbatista.net/assets/documents/dsbatista-cv.en.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

I'm also the creator and maintainer of [Politiquices.PT](https://www.politiquices.pt){:target="_blank"} a semantic graph connected with Wikidata, which allows exploring political interactions of support and opposition based on archived news articles from the past 25 years.

I occasionally write <a href="/posts/" target="_blank"><b>blog posts</b></a> mostly about Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I have a strong interest in the following topics:

* Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics
* Information Extraction: Named-Entity Recognition and Relationship-Extraction, Entity Linking
* Knowledge Bases and Semantic Graphs
* Machine Learning and Neural Networks applied to NLP tasks
