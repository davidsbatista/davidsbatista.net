This page contain links to list for public datasets used in different NLP tasks, I try to keep the lists updated as I found new and interesting datasets.

## __Relationship Extraction__

I've been keeping track of public and free datasets for semantic relationship extraction, this [github repository](https://github.com/davidsbatista/Annotated-Semantic-Relationships-Datasets) contains annotated datasets which can be used to train supervised models to perform semantic relationship extraction.

The datasets are organized into three different groups:

* [__Traditional Information Extraction__](https://github.com/davidsbatista/Annotated-Semantic-Relationships-Datasets/blob/master/README.md#tie)

* [__Open Information Extraction__](https://github.com/davidsbatista/Annotated-Semantic-Relationships-Datasets/blob/master/README.md#oie)

* [__Distantly Supervised__](https://github.com/davidsbatista/Annotated-Semantic-Relationships-Datasets/blob/master/README.md#ds)

## __Named-Entity Recognition__

Named-Entity Recognition datasets organised by different languages, also some are for different domains:

* [__Portuguese__](https://github.com/davidsbatista/NER-datasets/tree/master/Portuguese)

* [__German__](https://github.com/davidsbatista/NER-datasets/blob/master/README.md#de)

* [__Dutch__](https://github.com/davidsbatista/NER-datasets/blob/master/README.md#nl)

* [__French__](https://github.com/davidsbatista/NER-datasets/blob/master/README.md#fr)

* [__English__](https://github.com/davidsbatista/NER-datasets/blob/master/README.md#en)

## __Lexicons and Dictionaries__

Several [lexicons](https://github.com/davidsbatista/lexicons) I gathered for different NLP tasks, including lists of names, acronyms and it's extensions, stop-words, overlap of names and toponyms, etc.:

* [NomesLex-PT](https://github.com/davidsbatista/lexicons/blob/master/NomesLex-PT.zip) a lexicon of Portuguese person names made up of 2,027 first names and 8,019 surnames.

* [names-surnames-NL-UK-IT-PT-ES.zip](https://github.com/davidsbatista/lexicons/blob/master/names-surnames-NL-UK-IT-PT-ES.zip) a list of names and surnames for Dutch, English, Portuguese and Spanish.

* [publico-cargos.txt](https://github.com/davidsbatista/lexicons/blob/master/publico-cargos.txt) a list of Portuguese noun quantifiers, i.e., words that occur before a proper noun, gathered from the on-line newspaper publico.pt.

* [publico-acronyms.txt](https://github.com/davidsbatista/lexicons/blob/master/publico-acronyms.txt) a list of acronyms and it's possible extensions, extracted from a collection of Portuguese news gathered from the on-line newspaper publico.pt.

* [wikipedia-acronyms.txt](https://github.com/davidsbatista/lexicons/blob/master/wikipedia-acronyms.txt) a list of acronyms and it's possible extensions, extracted from the English Wikipedia.

* [PT-stopwords.txt](https://github.com/davidsbatista/lexicons/blob/master/PT-stopwords.txt) a collections of stop-words for Portuguese.
