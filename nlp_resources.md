Learning about Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning is a continuous task, but there is always a starting point, where one learn the basics and the most common algorithms to solve some tasks.

Here I list some resources to learn more about Natural Language Processing, Machine learning and related areas. Most of this books/tutorials are things always nice to have around, and that you can quickly consult and clarify any doubts or review how certain algorithm or technique works.

I personally like to have  them in my library :)

#### [__"Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing"__](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1627052984/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=davidsbatista-21&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1627052984&linkId=cb3b0b4cc45ef3511d9eb92db8d34445)

I would recommend this book to anyone who is not a beginner and wants to make the jump from "classic NLP", i.e.: exploring hand-made features together with SVMs, HMM, CRFs and alike and wants to have a overview of how neural networks can be applied to several NLP tasks. It takes a very good overview on how neural networks took over NLP from the 2012/2013 up until 2016. It first covers the basics on neural networks and then slowly goes explains how they can be used to solve different NLP tasks, starting with more simple ones and going into specific ones, it contains many references to papers that at the time made the first breakthroughs on using neural networks for NLP.

I started my journey on NLP and Machine Learning back in 2007 with Information Retrieval, more precisely Geographic Information Retrieval. This book is a great start before you  jump into more advanced topics. It covers subjects related to indexing and retrieving documents and goes into great detail on the algorithms and techniques behind the scenes on a document search engine. It also covers some machine learning algorithms like Na√Øve Bayes and Support Vector Machines, and how they can be used for document retrieval.
