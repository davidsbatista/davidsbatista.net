#### __Portuguese Web Archive 2022: Politiquices.PT__ (portuguese)

[__Politiquices.PT__](https://www.politiquices.pt), which won the 2nd place on the Arquivo.pt Award 2021, allows us to explore support and opposition relationships between political personalities, extracted from news headlines of 25 years of Portuguese archived newspapers. The relationships are indexed in a SPARQL engine allowing the graph to be explored through SPARQL queries.
